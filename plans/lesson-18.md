### How it'll work

* Everyone will get 3 minutes to make their pitch: why should the rest of us join your project?
* Have your website up on the screen as you talk, and use it as a visual aid.
* When you're not presenting, take notes on projects you might want to join.
* You'll be allowed to rank your top four projects, anonymously to each other but not to me.
* Over the weekend, I'll synthesize these preferences into the groups we'll use moving forward.


### Presentations!

Here are the links, and we'll go in this order:


### Vote?
If time allows, and you're ready, we can [vote now](http://bit.ly/2inNOIF)!

## For next time:

**Inputs** 

* Review the criteria for the web design unit, and don't forget to scroll down.
* Review the pitch websites for your top four pitches, and think about what roles you might want to play, depending on the group you end up in.
* **Read** *Writer/Designer* chapter 5, on "Conceptualizing and Collaborating," and pay particular attention to the team contract – you'll be writing one next class.

**Outputs**

* **[Vote](http://bit.ly/2inNOIF)** as soon as you can! By end-of-day Friday if possible. I'll compile all the preferences into groups as soon as I have them all. 
* **Finalize** your website *and reflection*, and post them to GitHub.

**Administrative**

* If you haven't yet, sign up for a midterm conference with Ben next week. 
 - If we haven't done this by Thursday 11/9, it'll count as a missed conference – and we should still meet as soon as possible. 
 - If none of the available times works for you, contact me.
