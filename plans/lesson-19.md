## Contracting into Teams

**Texts to have read / found / watched** 

* *Writer/Designer* chapter 5, on "Assembling Your Technologies and Your Team." (I apparently made the mistake of checking the chapter title on Amazon, and looked at the wrong version. I hope you just read chapter 5, regardless of the name.)
* The [criteria](http://bit.ly/cdm2017fall) for the web design unit

**Work to have done**

* Final version of your pitch website, with reflection, pushed to GitHub

### Reflection: What Makes Groups Work?
W/D p. 83


### New Groups!


### Team Contract Negotiations and Drafting


Further considerations: Will you use GitHub for collaboration? Whose account will host the repo? Make sure everyone has editing access to your shared filespace before you leave.

Turn in a version by the end of class. It's okay to be flexible, and you can revise by mutual agreement. But if you really feel your contract is unfinished, say that at the top – and try to finish it by Thursday, because we're heading into the formal proposal stage next.

### EXT: Using the GitHub issue queue to assign tasks



## For next time:

**Inputs**
* Begin research toward your group project
* Re-read *Writer/Designer* chapter 5 in light of your new groups, especially the section on "Proposing to Get it All Done."

**Outputs**
* If you haven't yet finished 
* Prepare to collaboratively compose a group project proposal on Thursday; this may mean drafting together in a Google doc or the like, and if you have the time you may want to start before Thursday.
* Last chance to sign up for a midterm conference and not be late (I've had the deadline at 11/9 for several weeks)
