## Office Hours
To book an appointment with me (Ben), head over to <strong><a href="https://benmiller314.youcanbook.me">benmiller314.youcanbook.me</a></strong>. I've reserved **Tuesday 11am-1pm** as my default office time, so you can generally find me there even for a walk-in; during some weeks – especially early in the semester and around midterm – I'll have extended hours, and I'll ask everyone to make an appointment.

To get to my office, which is CL 617 N, go through the doors closest to the elevators and take the right-hand branch of the hallway almost to the end.
