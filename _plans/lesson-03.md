### Studio time: Practice with GIMP / Photoshop



## Homework for Next Time

* **Administrative**
 1. If you haven't yet, please **fill out** the [Tech Comfort Survey](https://goo.gl/forms/Y6SZfG9Od2JUw1y42).
 2. **Install** GIMP on a machine that you're likely to use at home
* **Inputs**
 1. **Read** pages 63-76 in *Writer/Designer*, which is part of chapter 4. It deals with "Ethics of Collecting Sources and Assets." 
 2. **Read** quickly through the Stanford library's [website on Copyright and Fair Use](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/), paying particular attention to the section on [Measuring Fair Use: the Four Factors](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/) and anything else that seems especially pertinent to you.
 3. EXT: **Watch** an introductory tutorial on GIMP if you want something extra to help you get oriented. There's a Lynda tutorial called ["GIMP Essential Training"](https://www.lynda.com/GIMP-tutorials/Touring-GIMP-interface/572891/626849-4.html) that covers a *lot* (it's like 5 hours long), but starts with a 5 *minute* intro to the interface.
  * You can access Lynda tutorials through [my.pitt.edu](https://my.pitt.edu); look for the link in the sidebar. ![lynda link, screenshot from my.pitt sidebar](assets/img/lynda-link.png)
* **Outputs**
 1. **Consider**: where did you find the images you posted for lesson 3? Are you able to get back to them easily? Did you embed any citation information when you posted them to our website? Do you have permission to reuse or modify these images? 
 2. **Update or change** the info in our media library, as necessary. (Go to the dashboard, then Media, then Library, and use the filters to navigate.)
 3. **Write** any questions you have so far – about any of our readings, but perhaps especially about ethical sourcing – and post them to our blog under the Reflections category.
