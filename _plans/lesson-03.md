## How Lo(fi) Should We Go?
**Texts to have read**:

* Stolley, [“The Lo-Fi Manifesto, v. 2.0”](http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/20.2/inventio/stolley/)
* Git Basics videos ["#1 What is VCS?"](https://youtu.be/8oRjP8yj2Wo), ["#4 Quick Wins with Git"](https://youtu.be/7w5Z7LmyLgI), and ["#2 What is Git?"](https://youtu.be/uhtzxPU7Bz0)

**Work to have done**:

* A registered **GitHub** account, with a completed "Hello World" tutorial
* A brief **reflection** posted to the blog under the "reflections" category
* Post three **images** that we can start remixing

## Homework for Next Time

* **Read** pages 63-76 in *Writer/Designer*, which is part of chapter 4. It deals with "Ethics of Collecting Sources and Assets." 
* **Read** quickly through the Stanford library's [website on Copyright and Fair Use](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/), paying particular attention to the section on [Measuring Fair Use: the Four Factors](http://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/fair-use/four-factors/) and anything else that seems especially pertinent to you.
* **Consider**: where did you find the images you posted for lesson 3? Are you able to get back to them easily? Did you embed any citation information when you posted them to our website? Do you have permission to reuse or modify these images? **Update or change** the info in our media library, as necessary. (Go to the dashboard, then Media, then Library, and use the filters to navigate.)
* **Write** any questions you have so far – about any of our readings, but perhaps especially about ethical sourcing – and post them to our blog under the Reflections category.
