### Key Questions and Considerations (20-30 min)
**On copyright**
> Does all of my work technically have a copyright? ([Caleb](https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/lesson-3-reflection-2/))

<span class="text-success"><strong>Yes</strong></span>, unless you signed your rights to it away (e.g. to a company like Turnitin). You don't need to register your work with the U.S. Copyright  Office; rather, "Your work is under copyright protection the moment it is created and fixed in a tangible form that it is perceptible either directly or with the aid of a machine or device" ([copyright.gov/faq](https://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/faq-general.html#register)).

**On Google Images and the Public Domain**
> If I can find something on Google Images, it must be available for public use, right? ([Abby](https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/a-reflection-on-fair-use/))

<span class="text-danger">Alas, <strong>no</strong></span> – it's in a public space, but you're no more guaranteed the right to reproduce or modify the image than you are to take and eat a cookie from a bake sale without paying, even if the bake sale is set up outside the public library. In both cases, there's a good chance someone is putting those items there to attract your attention for the purposes of some other transaction. Google Images will turn up commercial sites, professional photography portfolios, and things like this, for which the artists and photographers have a reasonable right to expect compensation (which may be based on page hits that your reproduction of the image will take away).

But luckily, Google Images does provide some tools to filter its results to works you *can* use:

![Search for a copyleft image of a kid eating spaghetti](assets/img/google-images-search-by-usage-rights.gif)

Note that this took us to [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com), one of several good permissive (or "copy*left*") image repositories. You can access several of them by starting your search at [search.creativecommons.org](https://search.creativecommons.org)

But note that even this is not a guarantee; it's just here for convenience:

**On Fair Use**
> How is it fair that "fair use involves subjective judgments, often affected by factors such as a judge or jury’s personal sense of right or wrong," or that "a morally offended judge or jury may rationalize its decision against fair use?" The fact that a fair use trial is in the hands of potentially biased individuals does not seem, well, fair. ([Abby](https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/a-reflection-on-fair-use/))

Fair point (pun acknowledged) – but the thing is, there's no way to make a standard that will function with pure objectivity, and no person (or [even algorithm](https://www.google.com/search?q=bias+in+algorithms)) that can be entirely free of bias. So we need humans, fallible though they are, to adjudicate questions like these:

> What is officially considered a small portion of the whole work? ([Gwen](https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/some-reading-questions/))

> I've heard that any artist/creator has an unofficial copyright on their work, and if someone else tries to use it, the original creator (if there is no official copyright) must provide proof that they created it first. However, I have also heard that as long as a user modifies found images, they are free to use them for whatever purpose. [...] where is the line drawn for what is modified enough and what isn't? ([Alyssa](https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/lesson-3-reading-reflection/))

> There seems to be a fine line as to what constitutes fair use based on the purpose and character of use. I remember in art class in high school our teacher never let us use reference pictures that we hadn't taken ourselves for paintings. Where is the line drawn for what is fair to use when creating a new work? ([Taylor](https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/reflection-on-fair-use/))


All of these questions are answered on a case-by-case basis, by weighing the four factors: **purpose of use**, **nature of the copyrighted work**, **amount of work cited**, and **market effect of the use**. Sometimes those factors point in different directions; what you choose to do as a creator in that situation depends on your estimation of the risk that you'll either do harm or be harmed (e.g. by a lawsuit), and your tolerance level for the risk you've calculated.

**On Citation and Credibility**
> The book has a rule that if you cite something, a reader must be able to find it themselves. What if it's not something that is easily accessible? Like a copyright of a recording on someone's iPhone? A reader wouldn't be able to find that, so how would the reader know it's a credible source? ([Alyssa](https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/lesson-3-reading-reflection/))

> The image in question is of an old woman's eyes, and it's a thumbnail from a video from a website that looked sort of shady. Since the photo is not a central aspect of the video, and the website itself doesn't seem to have any actual merit, do I still have to credit the original uploader? ([Jeff](https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/lesson-3-reflection/))

As with fair use, how much of a citation is required, and whether it helps or hurts your case, is going to be very context-dependent. Credibility is rhetorical: you build your ethos, your projected authorial self, through the way you incorporate source material. If you're pulling from "shady" sites, does that make you a great scavenger of overlooked found material – or does it make you, yourself, seem shady? If you're drawing on a video you took yourself, does that make you isolated from the public conversation – or does it make you an independent filmmaker? Depends on who's reading, and what you're doing with the material.

In general, though, it's not necessary to cite something unpublished, especially if it's work you prepared yourself. And it's generally a right friendly gesture to offer credit for work you didn't yourself prepare.


**On Privacy**
> The pictures I chose were ones of my family friends for their wedding. While I know these are considered fair use, I wonder if I need to get their permission to publish them in any way on the internet, even if they are part of a school project. [...] Perhaps just checking with the subjects of my photo will be enough to at least ensure that their privacy is not violated. ([Jappman](https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/copywrite-reflection/))

I know we're getting a little long into this run of questions, but this one seems important, and related to my last comment above: even when something isn't required or prohibited by law, it's just good ethics to think about the people who might be affected by your actions. That includes, yes, all the commercial impact stuff that comes up with fair use; but it also includes people's reasonable expectations of privacy. If it's not hard to get in touch with the person whose photograph you want to use, why not do so? The worst they can say is no.

One final, related note: this site is public and searchable on the open web, as I mentioned on the first day of class. Even though the site is for educational purposes, if you're not transforming the image by commenting on it or changing its meaning, it's probably better to find an image you feel more solid defending as a fair or licensed use.
