## Fair Enough
**Texts to have read**:

* chapters 1 and 2 in *Writer/Designer*, on defining and analyzing multimodal projects
* tutorials toward your visual project and/or keeping track of it

**Work to have done**:

* some progress on your visual project, to get a sense of what's easily doable and what's a likely stretch goal
* at least one new git commit per working session, with a meaningful commit message
* bring in one thing you've figured out how to do with GIMP, to share with your group

Today we'll be going in and out of groups, which I've left alone for the time being:

* Alyssa, Abby, Gabi
* Annie, Lucas, Taylor
* Caleb, Jack, Sammie
* Casey R, Jojo, Will
* Casey T, Jappmann, Jill
* Eli, Gwen, Jeff

### Name Game
We'll use the second person to tell each other, "You are __[name]__."

As you say each name, make direct eye contact with the person you're talking to. This puts them right in the center of your field of vision, improving memory retention.
We'll go around the room, cumulatively. As we go, everyone should be trying to learn the names at the same time: your turn to talk, then, is not the only turn that matters. Help everyone make that eye contact.
If you can't remember someone's name, just make eye contact, apologize, and ask.

To make eye contact more possible, please stand around the edges of the room. In other words, if you're in one of the middle rows, please head to the front or the back.

I'll start!

### Quick review of the unit project assignment (2 min)
You already have the <a href="https://cdm2017.majoringinmeta.net/documents/2017/09/prompt-for-assignment-1.pdf">handout</a>, but here are the basics:

* **The goal** is to produce a single composite image that draws attention to something of your choice. 
* **Related genres** include posters, fliers, album covers, book covers, infographics, maybe even bookmarks. 
 * There's no need to print these out, since full-bleed printing and stock paper get expensive.
* **The first draft** is due in two days (Th 9/14), when we'll have workshop. The **final draft** is due in 2.5 weeks (Tu 9/26).
* **The content** is up to your interests: what do you want to direct the rest of the class's attention to?
 * *Parachute prompt:* If you can't think of anything else, make an infographic about one of the reading assignments, i.e. on the Five Principles of New Media, or on the Lo-Fi Manifesto, or on Fair Use. For some examples of academic infographics, see the <a href="https://thinkerthoughtinfo.tumblr.com/">Thinker/Thought tumblr</a>, showcasing work by Nathaniel Rivers, a professor at St. Louis University.
 * ALT: You may, if you wish, do a major redesign of an existing visual appeal; if you want to take this option, though, please run it by me first. 


### Sharing plans and progress (20-30 min)
In groups, bring each other up to speed. It may be useful to use the terms from *Writer/Designer*: who is your *audience*? what's the *context*? do you have any additional *purpose* for the document, apart from the general one in the prompt? what *authorial ethos* do you want to project? what does that suggest you use for *genre*?

### Building criteria

### Analytical tools as generative heuristics

The authors of *Writer/Designer* offered us a bunch of lenses to use when we examine any multimodal text:

<div class="row clearfix">
<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 pull-left">
<strong>Rhetorical Situation</strong>
<ul>
<li>audience</li>
<li>purpose</li>
<li>context</li>
<li>author / ethos</li>
<li>genre</li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- /.pull-left -->

<div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 pull-right">
<strong>Design Elements</strong>
<ul>
<li>emphasis</li>
<li>contrast</li>
<li>organization</li>
<li>alignment</li>
<li>proximity</li>
</ul>
</div> <!-- /.pull-right -->
</div> <!-- /.row -->






### Studio Time / Planning and Sketching
I'm going to give you the rest of the day to work on your projects, and to call me over with questions that Google can't help you with. 

<div class="alert alert-success">
Recommended starting points; either pick one or do them in sequence:
<ul>
<li>Take a few minutes to make a list of the possibilities for your content. What are you interested in or excited about right now, that you might want to share with others?</li>
<li>If you know you want to work in a particular genre, take a few minutes to think over examples of that genre that struck you as excellent. What were they doing that caught your eye? What's happening or appealing in your life right now that their designs remind you of?</li>
<li>Make 2-4 different design sketches on paper, then try to make them happen in software.</li>
</ul>
</div>

## Before we leave...

1. Add me as a collaborator to your project repository on GitHub:
!["screencast showing steps to add a collaborator"]({{site.baseurl}}assets/img/add-a-collaborator-to-a-gh-repo.gif)
 a. From your repository on GitHub, click on the "Settings" menu
 b. You'll get a navigation menu on the left; select "Collaborators"
 c. Search by username for 'benmiller314' – that's me!
 d. Click the "Add collaborator" button.
2. Can I have 3-5 volunteers to have your project workshopped on Thursday? 
 * I'll ask you to put your work on the big screen, and we'll take 10 minutes talking through what it's doing, where it's working well, and where it might go next (describe / evaluate / suggest)
 * I know there were several of you who professed to a high comfort level creating / working on primarily visual texts...

## Homework for Next Time

* **Administrative**
 1. If you haven't yet done so, please do add me as a collaborator to your repo on GitHub, so I can see how your work is progressing. (If it's not working, please do email me.)
 2. You have the option of creating a single repo for the course, or separate repositories for each project. There are pros and cons each way.
 3. You may also want to add your groupmates as collaborators, to facilitate feedback...
* **Inputs**
 1. Review the collaborative criteria that we developed today.
* **Outputs**
 1. If you're being workshopped, **bring** a working draft of your visual media project, as a Photoshop- or GIMP-native file, on a flash drive or accessible cloud account. (We need to get it to the projecting computer.)
 2. Everyone,
