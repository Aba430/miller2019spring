## Office Hours
To book an appointment with me (Ben), head over to <strong><a href="https://benmiller314.youcanbook.me">benmiller314.youcanbook.me</a></strong>. I've reserved Wednesday 2-4pm as my default office time, so you can generally find me there even for a walk-in; during some weeks – especially early in the semester and around midterm – I'll have extended hours, and I'll ask everyone to make an appointment.

To get to my office, which is CL 617 N, go through the doors closest to the elevators and take the right-hand branch of the hallway almost to the end. 


## Services at Pitt
<dl>
<dt><a href="http://dmap.pitt.edu/">DMAP site</a></dt>
<dd>The English department maintains a Digital Media And Pedagogy site with a number of useful resources, including <a href="http://dmap.pitt.edu/equipment">recording equipment</a> you can check out, easy-to-reserve office hours with either a grad student or faculty digital media consultant, and a way to reserve the DMAP studio (CL 463) for up to eight people.</dd>

<dt><a href="http://www.writingcenter.pitt.edu/">Pitt Writing Center</a></dt>
<dd>Though not every consultant will have experience in multimodal composing or digital media, some will; but more importantly, the Writing Center's emphases on process-oriented reflection and rhetorical thinking makes every consultant a useful sounding board for your projects. It's a good idea to <a href="http://www.writingcenter.pitt.edu/undergraduate-services">plan for your visit</a> and to make an appointment before you go.</dd>

## Free and Licensed Images, Music, and Other Assets
<dl>
<dt><a href="search.creativecommons.org">search.creativecommons.org</a></dt>
<dd>A portal for searching multiple sites that have built-in CC licensing, including flickr, jamendo, and ccmixter</dd>

<dt><a href="https://www.fontsquirrel.com/">Font Squirrel</a></dt>
<dd>Fonts that are free for personal <em>and</em> commercial uses, making them especially handy for advertising campaigns and the like.
 The site also includes some useful educational resources for learning more about font history and font selection.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a></dt>
<dd>A liberally licensed icon sets aiming to create "icons for everything," though as the name suggests, they specialize in <em>things</em>, rather than actions. If you realize you don't want all the detail of a photo when a simple line drawing would get the idea across, try searching their million-plus collection.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a></dt>
<dd>I just found out about this one at the start of the semester, and I'm pretty excited: it's a collection of high-res, large-scale images that are free for personal <em>and</em> commercial uses; they may be especially useful for splashy website headers.</dd>

<dt><a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/">Adobe Color CC</a></dt>
<dt><a href="http://paletton.com/">Paletton</a></dt>
<dt><a href="http://www.color-hex.com/">Color-Hex</a></dt>
<dd>Tools for color selection, for when you want to find a palette of complementary tones, or just to find the hex codes along an axis of saturation or intensity.</dd>

## Unit-Specific Resources
*This section will expand as we move forward; feel free to suggest others that you come across!*

### Visual
Under the <a href="#free-and-licensed-images-music-and-other-assets">assets listings</a> above, you might find FontSquirrel and The Noun Project especially pertinent here.
<dl>
<dt>GIMP Tutorials</dt>
<dd>You can find quite a few intro-level tutorials on the GIMP site itself, at <a href="https://www.gimp.org/tutorials">www.gimp.org/tutorials</a>, including "GIMP Quickies" and a tutorial on layer manipulation called "Simple Floating Logo."</dd>

<dt>Examples of Static Visual Appeals</dt>
<dd><a href="https://thinkerthoughtinfo.tumblr.com/">Thinker/Thought</a>, a collection of academic infographics by Nathaniel Rivers. In addition to being useful for how he handles design elements, quotation, and citation, some of the content deals with ideas on multimedia composing and rhetoric.</dd>
</dl>

### Web Design
<dl>
<dt><a href="https://templated.co/">templated.co</a></dt>
<dt><a href="https://html5up.net/">html5up.net</a></dt>
<dd>There are a lot of websites that offer collections of free website themes and templates. These are two of my favorite sources for starting up static sites with built-in semantic html5 and responsive css.</dd>
</dl>

## Other Resource Roundups

Especially in the realm of digital production, there's no need to reinvent the wheel; just as there are many excellent tutorials and sites on which to locate assets, there are many excellent <em>lists</em> of such tutorials and sites. Here are a few to draw on: 
<ul>
 	<li>Noel Tague's <a href="https://cdmspring2017.wordpress.com/bag-of-tricks/">bag of tricks</a> is quite extensive, and includes sections on fair use, on archives of materials you can use or cite, on strategies for working with audio and video, and links to free / open source software.</li>
 	<li>Annette Vee's <a href="http://annettevee.com/2016cdm/resources/">CDM resources page</a>, which includes guidance on GitHub and Markdown (a widely used shorthand for HTML, with a bunch of variants a.k.a. "flavors").</li>
</ul>

As the semester goes on, we can identify our own list of favorites!
