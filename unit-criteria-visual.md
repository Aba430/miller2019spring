# Visual Unit Criteria

## All projects for this unit should...

**in the visual itself:**

* Successfully merge more than one image together
* Alter at least one image, rather than just copying and pasting
* Include both visual and linguistic elements
* Use contrast effectively to create focus

**in the artist's statement:**

* Indicate where source materials were found and explain the writer/designer's right to use them (e.g. fair use rationale or meeting the terms of a Creative Commons license)
* Reflect on the process of creating the visual: goals, challenges, solutions
* Make reference to design choices (emphasis, contrast, alignment, organization, proximity, but also color, element, framing, sequence) made in creating the final visual


## The best projects for this unit may...
* Make significant changes to a source element's meaning
* Dramatically alter an image through special effects, filters, or adjustments
* Include entirely new images created for this project
* Effectively target a particular audience
* Make coherent, consistent use of emphasis, contrast, alignment, organization, and proximity
* Enact the conventions of a particular genre or subgenre
* Make use of multiple tools or resources that were new to the writer/designer


### Other possibilities, not sure if they're baseline or aspirational:
* More than one font?
* Minimum number of elements / layers?
* Advance an original idea?
* Have a clear message or call to action?
